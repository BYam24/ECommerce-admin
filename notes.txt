We have parentheses over some folders to omit the folder from the URL 

Ex: 
app 
|-layout.ts
|-(marketing)
   |- about
      |- page.ts
   |- blog
      |- page.ts
|-(shops)
   |-account
      |- page.ts

The url of the route to account is simply /account because we omit shop

We need to "use client"
In Next.js, the "use client" directive is used to explicitly indicate that a file or a part of the code should be executed on the client side (in the browser) instead of the server side. This is particularly important in a framework like Next.js that supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), as well as client-side rendering (CSR).
